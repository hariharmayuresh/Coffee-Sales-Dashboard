## 📊 Project Summary

This project is inspired by [Mochan's YouTube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m13o5aqeCbM) on building a comprehensive and interactive Excel dashboard for coffee sales. The dashboard is built using real-world-style data, transformed using advanced Excel functions and presented with visually intuitive pivot charts and slicers.

It covers the full analytical workflow — from importing and cleaning data to visualizing KPIs, trends, and top-performing products. Designed to be interactive and user-friendly, this dashboard helps stakeholders make fast, informed decisions.
